## Overview
This repository contains a basic web data scraping program using Python, showcasing the use of two powerful libraries: **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy**. These tools allow for efficient extraction of data from websites.

## Libraries Used
- **BeautifulSoup**: A library for parsing HTML and XML documents. It makes it easy to navigate and search through the parse tree.
- **Scrapy**: A powerful framework for web scraping that allows you to extract data from websites and handle multiple requests efficiently.

## How to Run

### Running Scrapy
To run the Scrapy spider, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
scrapy crawl matcha
```

Make sure you are in the correct directory where your Scrapy project is located and correct name of spider is entered.

### Running BeautifulSoup

```bash
python .\data-scraper-BeautifulSoup-dynamic.py
